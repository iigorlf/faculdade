 <audio src="audio/Travis Scott - MY EYES (ONLY SECOND HALF-PART).mp3"controls></audio>
 <br>
 Look in my eyes, tell me a tale<br>
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?<br>
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face<br>
Am I picture-perfect, or do I look fried?<br>
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'<br>
Tell you demise, I went to my side<br>
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide<br>
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a sea of people that ride wit' me<br>
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child<br>
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me inspired (hah)<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
That shit wild, instead I'm a hero<br>
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain<br>
I run it from miles, this shit wasn't luck<br>
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around<br>
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground<br>
They say they the ones when they make the errors<br>
Can't look in the mirror, that shit wild<br>
Stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage<br>
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it<br>
We do it for streets, we do it for keeps, we do it for rights, got 52 weeks<br>
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak<br>
This shit is forever and infinity<br>
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around<br>
I take me beat and I turn to a beast<br>
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach<br>
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed<br>
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time<br>
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease<br>
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat<br>
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat<br>
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink<br>
<br>
